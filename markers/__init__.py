This directory is to hold CheckWiki's marker scripts. Each script downloads
error list from server, checks one error in the corresponding articles and
marks all fixed errors as done.
Adapted for ruwiki. Do not use this bot on other wikis!

Usage:
    python markall.py [path-to-markers]

Make sure that checkwiki.py and user-config.py modules are available.
